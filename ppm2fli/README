/* README */

This package includes the sources of the programs `ppm2fli' and `unflick'.

ppm2fli:  This program generates FLI/FLC animation files from a series 
          static images.
unflick:  It does the opposite of `ppm2fli'. It can extract the images of 
          a FLI animation. 

PPM2FLI can read directly PPM,PGM,PBM and FBM files. If necessary it
performs a quantization. The filters of the NETPBM, PBMPLUS and FBM package
can be used as read filters. Together with one of this packages
a large number of image formats can be handled.

UNFLICK writes images in PPM or FBM format. 

In contrast to FBM2FLI no additional package is required to build 
PPM2FLI and UNFLICK. So it can be used without any of the above mentioned 
packages, if another source of PPM,PGM,PBM or FBM images is available.
For example, PS images can be animated using ghostscript.

PPM2FLI is supposed to be easier to install and easier to use than FBM2FLI.
But in some points is may be less flexible.

The current version is call `beta' because some parts are relative new
and not totally tested. I made tests on SUN sparc-stations (various versions
of SUN-OS), on PC running LINUX and under MSDOS using the DJGPP DOS-extender.
In all cases the GCC compiler was used. Under MSDOS I used a modified
makefile. Anyway, in some environments changes in the makefile are necessary.
